Technology used:

- react
- tailwind

npx create-react-tailwind-app
the less tech i use the better it is

Learned:

- Latest tailwind versions
- Craco
- gitgraph
- git2json

Complications / Questions:

- getting good data is not easy
- table scrolled what ui is suppose to behave like, header specifically
- default active for origins (first item should be opened ?)
- what is maximum size of the layout, what will happen on the extra large screens

Notes:

- Will recommend a UX of debounced filter, remove Filter button, add debounced on change directly on the input field ("When a user types text into the filter input, it should immediately show the
  filtered results" is confusing)

TODO:

- Width of the browser md to 800px
- Commit properly to git every day worked
